# SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

# Introduction

SCADA is an industrial automation control system used for gathering real-time data from remote locations and controlling equipment from a centralized system. It plays a vital role in power transmission systems, where it's used to monitor line status, measure voltages/currents, detect faults, and issue control commands.
