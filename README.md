# SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

# Introduction

SCADA is an industrial automation control system used for gathering real-time data from remote locations and controlling equipment from a centralized system. It plays a vital role in power transmission systems, where it's used to monitor line status, measure voltages/currents, detect faults, and issue control commands.

# Key Features:

Continuous monitoring of electrical parameters (voltage, current, frequency).

Control of switches, circuit breakers, and capacitor banks.

Alarm systems and fault detection.

Historical data logging and trend analysis.

# MTU (Master Terminal Unit):

Located at the control center.

Collects and processes data from RTUs.

# RTU (Remote Terminal Unit):

Placed at substations or field locations.

Collects data from sensors and sends it to the MTU.

# PLC (Programmable Logic Controller):

Handles automation logic (e.g., trip breakers on fault detection).

# HMI (Human-Machine Interface):

Visual interface for human operators to monitor and control equipment.

# Communication Infrastructure:

Wired (fiber optics, coaxial cables) or wireless (radio, satellite).

Protocols like Modbus, DNP3, IEC 60870-5-104.
